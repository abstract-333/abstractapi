<p>Note that to test this in windows you need waitress, becuase gunicorn didn't supported in windows.<p>
<p>To run waitress (windows):<p>
<bold>waitress-serve --listen=127.0.0.1:8000 <name of your app>:app</bold>
<p>To run gunicorn (Linux, Mac):<p>
<bold>gunicorn <name of your app>:app</bold>
<p>Otherwise gunicorn works well in other platforms.<p>
